# Oscillator/Sequencer Project:
While taking Electronics 2 during my third year of mechatronics studies at Queen's University I really enjoyed learning about how to analyse oscillator circuits. This lead me to start making my own oscillator at home. However, oscillators don't sound too good on their own. To fix that issue, I learned how to make a sequencer using it to play musical notes with the oscillator.
